<h1>The Age of Legends</h1>

<p>Sinora Maldrán, Mother of Wisdom, proclaimed in the prime age of Shilawén:
"The day will come where darkness covers the land. Darkness, arisen from within us,
strengthened and nurtured by us, but which eventually will rule us. Than the black gorge of
oblivion will engulf us and our folk will return to dust. But a small seed will be able to
escape and will prosper again in another world, prosper with a strength, we could provide."</p>

<p>fter her last words faded away she broke her crook as a sign of sacrifice. Her lifeless
body fell to the ground and the force within her found a new vessel. The only thing that was
found at her body was a sealed scroll.</p>

<p>The true origin of the Gods of Illarion is clouded in mystery, and only very scarse
information was able to be gathered. The elves seems to know the most, as they were the first to
keep a continuus record of their history, but their willingness to share this information is
small.</p>

<p>It seems to be that the world, the gods came from, was shattered due to a great conflict
arising between their kind. They might have been send to preserve the true essence of their own
existence, to collect powers as battle preparations, as a stronghold, or they just created the
world for another purpose.</p>

<p>The known history starts with the Age of Dawn.</p>
